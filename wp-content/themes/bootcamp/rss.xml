" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;    
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;Email marketing is a great strategy in which emails are sent out periodically to develop relationships with prospects and customers. The ideal goal of an email marketing strategy is to convert site visitors into customers and turn first-time buyers into recurring customers. One of the greatest advantages of using email marketing is that this whole process can be automated. Plus as your business grows, you will be able to build a strong list of emails of potential and existing customers. Every new product or course launch or a new offer email will then drive thousands to your business for free! Simply because you own that database and don't have to pay for that access anymore.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to increase website traffic and course sales with YouTube videos? | Knorish</title>
      <link>https://blog.knorish.com/how-to-increase-website-traffic-with-youtube-videos</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt; 
 &lt;a href="https://blog.knorish.com/how-to-increase-website-traffic-with-youtube-videos" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.knorish.com/hubfs/Using%20YouTube%20to%20Market%20Your%20Courses%20Blog%20Featured%20Image.jpg" alt="How to use YouTube Videos to drive traffic and sell courses faster?" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;    
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;Curating an online course has 2 major aspects: &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;creating&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;selling. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;So in order to sell more, you need to quickly figure out how to increase website traffic. Because without &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;traffic, you will not be able to market your product or generate any sales. This has been the biggest challenge for any creator. How to get the word out there, how to increase the website traffic organically, and get more sales. Videos are always a great form of engagement. But for some reason, in most cases, YouTube is never the first choice for promotions and marketing. If we were to take an educated guess, it's probably because creating video content is very intimidating.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;But the reality is you don't need millions of subscribers to get enough views and then traffic. Even if you have a very small group of people who subscribe to your videos, you can still drive a lot of traffic from YouTube and get sales.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;If you already create content on YouTube&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How To Bring Cart Abandoned Customers Back To Your Site To Purchase Your Courses?</title>
      <link>https://blog.knorish.com/how-to-bring-cart-abandoned-customers-back-to-your-site-to-purchase-your-courses</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt; 
 &lt;a href="https://blog.knorish.com/how-to-bring-cart-abandoned-customers-back-to-your-site-to-purchase-your-courses" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.knorish.com/hubfs/featured%20Image%201.jpg" alt="How to bring cart abandoned customers back to your site to purchase courses?" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;    
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal;"&gt;You have launched your courses, created the funnels, and set up the ads. But are you getting the sales numbers you need? Are your leads converting to customers, are they completing the payments or signing up, adding the course to their carts and leaving without buying anything?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal;"&gt;Every online business goes through this but there are several questions around this that creators have.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;"&gt;What is course abandonment? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;"&gt;How do I prevent it? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;"&gt;What do I do to bring those leads back?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 16px;"&gt;In this post, we will cover all this and more. But first, what is cart abandonment? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal;"&gt;So before understanding all of these issues let’s understand what is cart abandonment? And how does it affects your online course business? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal;"&gt;Cart abandonment by a learner occurs when the learner adds one of your online courses to his cart but ends up not making the purchase decision. It’s quite obvious it ain’t that great for your online business as you end up losing sales while missing out on an opportunity to provide great knowledge to your learners. &lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;U&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;nfortunately, a lot of shoppers tend to abandon the purchase process just at the last stage. And that results in a whole lot of issues for the business.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal;"&gt;And course cart abandonment is quite common in an online knowledge business. According to studies, &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/457078/category-cart-abandonment-rate-worldwide/"&gt;cart abandonment by a learner stands at 79.17% &lt;/a&gt;which is huge and not a great thing to hear when your primary source of revenue is your online course. With so much time, effort, and resources spent on new customer acquisition, having a customer leave towards the end of the sales funnel isn’t great for business.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 24px;"&gt;Reasons for cart abandonment by prospective leads&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal;"&gt;There are multiple reasons why a cart is abandoned by a learner. The most important and relevant ones are listed below:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 20px;"&gt;Doubt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal;"&gt;Yes, it can be as simple as doubt. Most customers who abandon the cart doubt the efficacy of their purchase decision. This can be due to:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;Lack of trust in the brand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;Multiple products with little to no differences&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;Unable to understand the actual need of the product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;Fear of missing out on a better deal after a certain period&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal;"&gt;With all of these doubts, a customer spirals into a sense of confusion. He begins questioning his decision-making and ends up hitting that back button. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal;"&gt;To tackle this we recommend you create a great sales landing page by using the Knorish Website Builder. With a host of themes, building one is super simple. All in all, you need to give a concrete reason justifying the sales. You can even reach out to these customers personally and understand the reason behind the doubt while providing a resolution for the same.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Build non-boring and high performing landing pages for your online academy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn the secrets to scale your online business’s revenue faster &amp;amp; higher with a great landing page. Watch the webinar: &lt;a href="https://academy.knorish.com/page/awesome-landing-pages"&gt;How to build awesome landing pages for your online academy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 20px;"&gt;Lack of a customer satisfaction guarantee message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: normal;"&gt;Often creators don’t include a customer satisfaction guarantee message. This message has to be shown within the sales page itself. Since we just discussed doubts, not inculcating a guaranteed message is a sure shot way to doubt in the mind of a potential customer. To tackle this through, creators should include a customer guarantee message within the sales page which helps in building trust and credibility in the eyes of a customer. It even ensures that the customer feels valuable with such thoughtfulness from a seller’s perspective. All in all a satisfied customer always purchases, therefore, it is crucial and highly recommended to include such a message.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;"&gt;Payment processing problems&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: normal;"&gt;Cards not going through or card declined! Yes, we all have faced this and it is highly annoying. Other payment processing issues include:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px;"&gt;Card declination&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px;"&gt;Internet banking failure due to bank blocks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px;"&gt;Wrong card information&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px;"&gt;Incorrect password used by a buyer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px;"&gt;Security blocks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: normal;"&gt;Not optimizing your payment mechanism is one of the key problems which results in cart abandonment by a learner. Once a potential learner is at the checkout page, all that a customer expects is to make the payment. At times a customer might refrain or feels too scared to provide you with his details which again can lead to a failed sales. Therefore take the necessary information while solving the privacy concerns of a buyer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 20px;"&gt;Internet issues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;This issue is faced by all. Situations may arise when the learner is ready to make the payment but his internet disconnects. This may cause too much frustration leading to a failed sales altogether. Therefore a prospective learner needs to understand that the internet might not work when they are about to hit that buy button. All we suggest to the learner is to have some amount of patience when dealing with online content. Retrying at a later time would have no harm and you can continue your learning efforts without any delay.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: normal;"&gt;With all these issues cropping up now let’s take a look at some of the strategies that can help in solving these problems and getting over cart abandonment by a learner.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 24px;"&gt;Strategies to get over cart abandonment &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal;"&gt;While we just discussed a lot of don’ts and issues that come up when buying, the truth is avoiding these completely is just not possible. Like we just discussed cart abandonment occurs due to a wide variety of reasons and it isn’t always your fault. Many times, a learner would abandon the cart due to issues having absolutely nothing to do with your company.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal;"&gt;A viewer might have added the product by mistake or was just casually browsing through the website without an intent to buy. For us understanding the main reason behind this abandonment is not critical, getting over it is the main challenge. All that matters is that the abandonment has happened and now our main goal is to get that course back into the cart of the learner which leads back to conversion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal;"&gt;Rather than hoping these customers will come back, as a seller you need to re-interact and engage with them as soon as possible. Whether you accomplish that by creating a FOMO or target them with ads, there are 9 different strategies with which you can win them over again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong style="font-size: 14px; background-color: transparent;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;Have a price beating pledge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;Many academies have offered a price beating pledge to potential customers. A price beating pledge is a psychological trick that has been used by marketers for a long duration of time. It can be the difference between a customer abandoning the cart or completing the purchase. It offers a sense of security in the mind of a learner. Some companies even offer a price matching guarantee as well. This can be quite helpful provided you are ready to offer a discount and reduce the price of the course.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;Create a sense of urgency or fear of mission out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;One of the most tried and tested formulas to win over customers is by creating a sense of urgency or FOMO.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;Urgency creates the fear of missing out. And that urgency can be anything. It can be a limited period discount, reduced price for a certain number of days, limited availability for a product. All of this creates a sense of scarcity which compels a potential learner to make a decision then and there. Creators can create time-based discount coupons by using the Knorish coupon creator. The coupon creator even has the functionality to create a coupon based on a percentage discount or a discount on the price. With this, a creator can create a coupon based on his choice while creating a fear of missing out in the minds of customers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 18px;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;Reach out to lost shoppers with specific ads&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;Specific targeted ads allow you to re-reach the customer. Specifically using Facebook and Google Adwords can be a great way to reach out to the customers. For this, we recommend you to keep a sizeable budget as advertising is not that pocket-friendly. It might not be a huge investment but requires a constant effort to have expected results. Creating ads is one side of the coin, creating specific ads while taking advantage of analytics is the other. You need to analyze data and create ads that are well received by a customer. This way you will be able to reach out specifically while saving a few bucks in the process of advertising.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;Now comes the question of what content to use within the ads. Our pick? Provide discount coupons while making the ad more graphic intensive. Use a lot of pictures and colors to attract the attention of a viewer. The colors will attract him while the coupon will push him to make the buying decision. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 &lt;a href="https://blog.knorish.com/how-to-bring-cart-abandoned-customers-back-to-your-site-to-purchase-your-courses" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.knorish.com/hubfs/featured%20Image%201.jpg" alt="How to bring cart abandoned customers back to your site to purchase courses?" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;    
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal;"&gt;You have launched your courses, created the funnels, and set up the ads. But are you getting the sales numbers you need? Are your leads converting to customers, are they completing the payments or signing up, adding the course to their carts and leaving without buying anything?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal;"&gt;Every online business goes through this but there are several questions around this that creators have.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;"&gt;What is course abandonment? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;"&gt;How do I prevent it? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;"&gt;What do I do to bring those leads back?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 16px;"&gt;In this post, we will cover all this and more. But first, what is cart abandonment? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal;"&gt;So before understanding all of these issues let’s understand what is cart abandonment? And how does it affects your online course business? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal;"&gt;Cart abandonment by a learner occurs when the learner adds one of your online courses to his cart but ends up not making the purchase decision. It’s quite obvious it ain’t that great for your online business as you end up losing sales while missing out on an opportunity to provide great knowledge to your learners. &lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;U&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;nfortunately, a lot of shoppers tend to abandon the purchase process just at the last stage. And that results in a whole lot of issues for the business.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal;"&gt;And course cart abandonment is quite common in an online knowledge business. According to studies, &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/457078/category-cart-abandonment-rate-worldwide/"&gt;cart abandonment by a learner stands at 79.17% &lt;/a&gt;which is huge and not a great thing to hear when your primary source of revenue is your online course. With so much time, effort, and resources spent on new customer acquisition, having a customer leave towards the end of the sales funnel isn’t great for business.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 24px;"&gt;Reasons for cart abandonment by prospective leads&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal;"&gt;There are multiple reasons why a cart is abandoned by a learner. The most important and relevant ones are listed below:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 20px;"&gt;Doubt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal;"&gt;Yes, it can be as simple as doubt. Most customers who abandon the cart doubt the efficacy of their purchase decision. This can be due to:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;Lack of trust in the brand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;Multiple products with little to no differences&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;Unable to understand the actual need of the product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;Fear of missing out on a better deal after a certain period&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal;"&gt;With all of these doubts, a customer spirals into a sense of confusion. He begins questioning his decision-making and ends up hitting that back button. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal;"&gt;To tackle this we recommend you create a great sales landing page by using the Knorish Website Builder. With a host of themes, building one is super simple. All in all, you need to give a concrete reason justifying the sales. You can even reach out to these customers personally and understand the reason behind the doubt while providing a resolution for the same.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Build non-boring and high performing landing pages for your online academy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn the secrets to scale your online business’s revenue faster &amp;amp; higher with a great landing page. Watch the webinar: &lt;a href="https://academy.knorish.com/page/awesome-landing-pages"&gt;How to build awesome landing pages for your online academy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 20px;"&gt;Lack of a customer satisfaction guarantee message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: normal;"&gt;Often creators don’t include a customer satisfaction guarantee message. This message has to be shown within the sales page itself. Since we just discussed doubts, not inculcating a guaranteed message is a sure shot way to doubt in the mind of a potential customer. To tackle this through, creators should include a customer guarantee message within the sales page which helps in building trust and credibility in the eyes of a customer. It even ensures that the customer feels valuable with such thoughtfulness from a seller’s perspective. All in all a satisfied customer always purchases, therefore, it is crucial and highly recommended to include such a message.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;"&gt;Payment processing problems&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: normal;"&gt;Cards not going through or card declined! Yes, we all have faced this and it is highly annoying. Other payment processing issues include:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px;"&gt;Card declination&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px;"&gt;Internet banking failure due to bank blocks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px;"&gt;Wrong card information&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px;"&gt;Incorrect password used by a buyer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px;"&gt;Security blocks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: normal;"&gt;Not optimizing your payment mechanism is one of the key problems which results in cart abandonment by a learner. Once a potential learner is at the checkout page, all that a customer expects is to make the payment. At times a customer might refrain or feels too scared to provide you with his details which again can lead to a failed sales. Therefore take the necessary information while solving the privacy concerns of a buyer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 20px;"&gt;Internet issues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;This issue is faced by all. Situations may arise when the learner is ready to make the payment but his internet disconnects. This may cause too much frustration leading to a failed sales altogether. Therefore a prospective learner needs to understand that the internet might not work when they are about to hit that buy button. All we suggest to the learner is to have some amount of patience when dealing with online content. Retrying at a later time would have no harm and you can continue your learning efforts without any delay.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: normal;"&gt;With all these issues cropping up now let’s take a look at some of the strategies that can help in solving these problems and getting over cart abandonment by a learner.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 24px;"&gt;Strategies to get over cart abandonment &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal;"&gt;While we just discussed a lot of don’ts and issues that come up when buying, the truth is avoiding these completely is just not possible. Like we just discussed cart abandonment occurs due to a wide variety of reasons and it isn’t always your fault. Many times, a learner would abandon the cart due to issues having absolutely nothing to do with your company.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal;"&gt;A viewer might have added the product by mistake or was just casually browsing through the website without an intent to buy. For us understanding the main reason behind this abandonment is not critical, getting over it is the main challenge. All that matters is that the abandonment has happened and now our main goal is to get that course back into the cart of the learner which leads back to conversion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal;"&gt;Rather than hoping these customers will come back, as a seller you need to re-interact and engage with them as soon as possible. Whether you accomplish that by creating a FOMO or target them with ads, there are 9 different strategies with which you can win them over again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong style="font-size: 14px; background-color: transparent;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;Have a price beating pledge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;Many academies have offered a price beating pledge to potential customers. A price beating pledge is a psychological trick that has been used by marketers for a long duration of time. It can be the difference between a customer abandoning the cart or completing the purchase. It offers a sense of security in the mind of a learner. Some companies even offer a price matching guarantee as well. This can be quite helpful provided you are ready to offer a discount and reduce the price of the course.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;Create a sense of urgency or fear of mission out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;One of the most tried and tested formulas to win over customers is by creating a sense of urgency or FOMO.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;Urgency creates the fear of missing out. And that urgency can be anything. It can be a limited period discount, reduced price for a certain number of days, limited availability for a product. All of this creates a sense of scarcity which compels a potential learner to make a decision then and there. Creators can create time-based discount coupons by using the Knorish coupon creator. The coupon creator even has the functionality to create a coupon based on a percentage discount or a discount on the price. With this, a creator can create a coupon based on his choice while creating a fear of missing out in the minds of customers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 18px;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;Reach out to lost shoppers with specific ads&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;Specific targeted ads allow you to re-reach the customer. Specifically using Facebook and Google Adwords can be a great way to reach out to the customers. For this, we recommend you to keep a sizeable budget as advertising is not that pocket-friendly. It might not be a huge investment but requires a constant effort to have expected results. Creating ads is one side of the coin, creating specific ads while taking advantage of analytics is the other. You need to analyze data and create ads that are well received by a customer. This way you will be able to reach out specifically while saving a few bucks in the process of advertising.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;Now comes the question of what content to use within the ads. Our pick? Provide discount coupons while making the ad more graphic intensive. Use a lot of pictures and colors to attract the attention of a viewer. The colors will attract him while the coupon will push him to make the buying decision. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
